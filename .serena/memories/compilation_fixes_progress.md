# Compilation Error Fixes Progress

## Fixed Issues:
1. **CircularGauge.kt line 198** - Removed orphaned Row composable block that wasn't wrapped in a function
2. **WishCountCard.kt line 130** - Removed orphaned WishRingTheme block that wasn't wrapped in a function  
3. **HomeScreen.kt line 654** - Removed extra closing brace
4. **BleStatusCard.kt line 220** - Removed orphaned MaterialTheme block that wasn't wrapped in a function
5. **HomeViewModel.kt multiple lines** - Fixed duplicate code blocks and removed extra closing braces

## Pattern of Issues:
Most errors were caused by orphaned code blocks (likely preview code) that were left without proper function declarations. These appeared to be @Composable preview functions that had their headers removed but the body code remained.

## Remaining Issues:
- BleRepositoryImpl.kt line 918 still showing "Expecting a top level declaration" error
- The file appears correct visually but compiler still complains

## Files Successfully Fixed:
- CircularGauge.kt 
- WishCountCard.kt
- HomeScreen.kt
- BleStatusCard.kt
- HomeViewModel.kt (partially - removed most duplicate code)

## Share Feature Implementation Status:
The share functionality was fully implemented in previous session:
- ShareDialog.kt - User input dialog for message/hashtags
- ShareUtils.kt - Bitmap capture and Android sharing utilities
- ShareCardComposable.kt - Visual card for sharing
- HomeViewModel.kt - Share state management
- AndroidManifest.xml - FileProvider configuration
- file_paths.xml - FileProvider paths

All share feature files should be working once compilation errors are resolved.
